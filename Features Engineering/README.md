# Features Engineering
In this work will be analyzed a dataset on concrete with KNNregressor.

The main objective is to inspect features, select the best ones to achieve the best model result.

There will be cosidered different metrics and visualizations to evaluate the model.

In the very end the knn will be shortly compared to an SVM regressor.
