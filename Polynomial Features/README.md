# Polynomial Features
In this work will be used the dataset of diabets on scikit-learn.
Models applied: linear regression, svm, random forest, neural network.

The idea behind this work is to test various models and try to achieve a good score (with various metrics) for the regression task.
The focus is on adding polynomial features and observe if there is an improvement on models predictions.
